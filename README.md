# XPSinv.jl
  this package should contain tools for the estimation of the concentration profiles of a  chemical species across a microjet (i.e. a very small stream) probed with X-rays. The data are the spectra of the emitted photoelectrons from the core state (i.e. 1s orbital).

I think it could include
  - model (deterministic and associated uncertainty)
  - some inversion methods (or these could be taken from another package, and only included in this package)
